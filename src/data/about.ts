  "Welcome to my portfolio! I'm excited to share my journey with you.",
  "I've always been passionate about gaming and creating; in fact, my favorite game of all time is Minecraft because of its limitless creativity. This passion led me to pursue a career in the gaming industry, where I can use my technical capabilities and analytical thinking to make and improve experiences for gamers.",
  "Right now, I'm an indie game developer at Origo Studios, a small team founded by me and my friends, where we're currently developing a top-down action game called Swarm2D. Being a part of the team has allowed to continuously learn and grow as a game designer, and I am very grateful for that.",
  "Outside of Origo, I also work on projects that strengthen my skills in data analysis and software engineering. I also play a lot of games since they're my primary source of inspiration for everything I do.",
  "I would say my greatest strength is problem-solving. I'm very proactive at identifying flaws and coming up with solutions. On teams, I'm always looking for ways to improve processes and make my teammates' work smoother and more enjoyable."
